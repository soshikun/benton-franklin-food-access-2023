                        Food insecurity is a prevalent issue that affects communities worldwide. It refers to the lack
                        of consistent access to quality food, leading to a lack of important nutrients that every human
                        needs. Food insecurity has large implications for physical health, mental health, and overall
                        quality of life. It disproportionately affects marginalized populations, including low-income
                        households, and minority communities. Food insecurity is often intertwined with other social and
                        economic challenges, such as poverty, unemployment, and limited access to affordable and
                        nutritious food options. Addressing food insecurity requires comprehensive strategies that focus
                        on improving food access, promoting sustainable agriculture, supporting local food systems, and
                        advocating for social justice. By understanding the complex factors contributing to food
                        insecurity, we can work towards creating equitable and resilient food systems that ensure
                        everyone has access to safe and nutritious food.

                        The accessibility of fresh and healthy produce or food is a very critical factor when promoting
                        community health and well-being. Communities should push to increase food accessibility rates as
                        it improves the quality of life and keeps the community healthy. The Benton-Franklin Food Access
                        & Security Coalition has recognized the need to improve its food accessibility and has tasked us
                        to aid in its improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was initiated to address the issue of food access in Benton and Franklin counties.
                        The project aimed to identify the locations of grocery stores, convenience stores, and
                        convenience stores that sell produce, and evaluate their accessibility based on different modes
                        of transportation. The lack of access to fresh and healthy food disproportionately affects
                        certain communities, contributing to health disparities and food insecurity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this project is to create an interactive web map that accurately shows the locations
                        of grocery stores, convenience stores, food services, and stores that sell produce located in
                        the Benton-Franklin counties. By analyzing and mapping the distribution of food resources, we
                        should be able to aid the Food Access & Security Coalition with their decision-making and
                        identify the areas they need to improve.

                        With our map, users will be able to see every type of store or food service, listed in four
                        different categories, along with the distance between each store and the desired type of
                        transportation (walk, bike, bus, or car).

                        This section outlines the technical specifications and resources that we used in order to
                        develop and deploy our interactive web map. It includes information regarding software,
                        hardware, and data requirements, covering all the technical aspects of this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the intended audience of the interactive web map was broader than simply the sponsors of the
                        Benton-Franklin Health District, and included the general public, we had to use opensource
                        applications including QGIS and GitHub in order to avoid issues with licensing that might appear
                        if the web map was hosted on a proprietary website instead. Ideally, there should be no
                        registration requirements for the average person to visit the website, nor should there be any
                        issues for our sponsors to access the files associated with the web map if needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the data had duplicate addresses, and did not contain geocoordinates, the data was first
                        processed with Python code in a Jupyter notebook, and with additional minor adjustments made to
                        the .csv file in Microsoft Excel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        QGIS was later used to calculate the distances of the individual locations as a means of
                        estimating which areas are most accessible for people who do not regularly have access to a
                        vehicle (therefore, public transit, walking, and biking as the main modes of transportation).
                        Buffers containing a walkable distance, or one that would be possible through the use of a bike
                        were calculated and then exported as .geoJSON files to be later uploaded on the GitHub page.
                        Almost all of the distances were calculated using Euclidean geometry, with the exception of
                        driving distances, which instead were calculated with a 10-minute approximate driving time via
                        road networks. This specific timed element was requested from us by our sponsors. A file with a
                        polygon estimate was produced for all four categories of stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After creating the map layers on QGIS, the individual layers had to be compiled together for the
                        interactive web map, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to make the map interactive. The
                        interactivity in our map comes from the ability to choose different layers or categories to be
                        portrayed on the map at the user’s preference. For example, users are able to click on a
                        specific category of a store like ‘convenience store’ and the map would show all of the
                        convenience stores in the area. Additionally, users are also able to click on each store
                        location in order to see its address and other related details.

                    <p>
                        This section introduces and describes the sources of data we used in this project, and describes
                        the steps taken in order to acquire the data. It also includes any data quality issues that were
                        encountered during the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As stated above, the first step within the process of data acquisition was to edit the .csv file
                        that was sent to us which was a complete list of all the food service locations that the Benton
                        Franklin Health Department had inspected in the two counties. Duplicate rows were deleted, and
                        additional columns were added to the .csv file for longitude and latitude coordinates with the
                        use of Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the .csv file did not specify which category a location belonged to (a grocery store, a
                        convenience store, or a store location that sold fresh produce) we also had to manually create a
                        column indicating that for each location, and research on the internet in order to determine how
                        to categorize the stores. We added a fourth category as well that was not specified in the
                        project request which was “food service,” or a location that otherwise did not fit any of the
                        other categories (for example, coffee shops, restaurants, dessert kiosks, etc).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This, however, was only for the base distance layers. The rest of the data used for this project
                        was acquired from reputable sources to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our map. For
                        stylistic purposes, a simple base map of the two counties and their borders had to be created,
                        which was edited from a shapefile provided by the U.S. Census government website. This base map
                        layer would allow the user to see where distances are relative within the boundaries of the
                        Benton and Franklin counties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To address the driving distance factor of our map, we also needed to get the road network data
                        for both Benton and Franklin counties which were acquired from data.gov. Shapefiles were used
                        and then merged to be able to compute the distance calculations for driving. Similarly, our
                        sponsor provided us with shapefiles that contained the transit bus routes and their stops, which
                        were also incorporated into the map.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As additional layers that at the present moment are still being developed, estimates from the
                        American Community Survey from the U.S. Census will be incorporated into the map as a means of
                        viewing population density, as well as which areas contain populations with high levels of
                        economic vulnerability, and would therefore best be served by additional locations that sell
                        fresh produce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, inputting all of the acquired data into one map, we have created an interactive web map
                        showing the location of each store or food service.
