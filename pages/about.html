                    Welcome to the Food Access 2023 interactive web map! This map is designed to provide valuable insights
                    into the accessibility of grocery stores, convenience stores, and produce-selling convenience stores
                    within the borders of Benton and Franklin counties. By examining various distances and means of
                    transportation, we aim to shed light on the relative availability of food resources in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary objective of this web map is to assist individuals, policymakers, and organizations in
                    understanding the food access landscape of Benton and Franklin counties. Access to fresh and healthy
                    food is a crucial factor in promoting community well-being and addressing food security concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data for this map is sourced from the Benton-Franklin Health District and the US Census. These reputable
                    sources ensure that the information presented is reliable and accurate. We extend our gratitude to both
                    organizations for providing the necessary data to create this map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this interactive web map, you can explore and analyze the distribution of grocery stores,
                    convenience stores, and produce-selling convenience stores within the two counties. The map provides
                    different distance thresholds and transportation modes, allowing you to assess the availability of food
                    resources according to your specific needs or research interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for using the Food Access 2023 web map. We hope that it serves as a valuable resource in
                    understanding and addressing food access challenges in Benton and Franklin counties.
